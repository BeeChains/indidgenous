We are here to assist you with Handshake($HNS) in 2022. Handshake decentralizes the ROOT ZONE FILE of the INTERNET like Bitcoin did money control.
We are changing the world wide web one "I" and Handshake 🤝 at a time.
- "Knowledge is a possession of the mind, Truth is experience of the soul. The "I" of the material mind perceives only a world of factual knowledge, but the "I" of spiritualized intellect discerns a world of true values." [Urantia Book](https://youtu.be/U8QF2u5aw5o?t=1719)
